Patient is a 45-year-old man with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma of the spine complicated by severe lower extremity weakness and urinary retention s/p Foley catheter, high-dose steroids, hypertension, and chronic pain. The tumor is located in the T-L spine, unresectable anaplastic astrocytoma s/p radiation. Complicated by progressive lower extremity weakness and urinary retention. Patient initially presented with RLE weakness where his right knee gave out with difficulty walking and right anterior thigh numbness. MRI showed a spinal cord conus mass which was biopsied and found to be anaplastic astrocytoma. Therapy included field radiation t10-l1 followed by 11 cycles of temozolomide 7 days on and 7 days off. This was followed by CPT-11 Weekly x4 with Avastin Q2 weeks/ 2 weeks rest and repeat cycle.

48 M with a h/o HTN hyperlipidemia, bicuspid aortic valve, and tobacco abuse who presented to his cardiologist on [**2148-10-1**] with progressive SOB and LE edema. TTE revealed severe aortic stenosis with worsening LV function. EF was 25%. RV pressure was 41 and had biatrial enlargement. Noted to have 2+ aortic insufficiency with mild MR. He was sent home from cardiology clinic with Lasix and BB (which he did not tolerate), continued to have worsening SOB and LE edema and finally presented here for evaluation.
During this admission repeat echo confirmed critical aortic stenosis showing left ventricular hypertrophy with cavity dilation and severe global hypokinesis, severe aortic valve stenosis with underlying bicuspid aortic valve, dilated ascending aorta, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient underwent a preop workup for valvular replacement with preop chest CT scan and carotid US (showing moderate heterogeneous plaque with bilateral 1-39% ICA stenosis). He also underwent a cardiac cath with right heart cath to evaluate his pulm art pressures which showed no angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary artery disease.

A 32 yo woman who presents following a severe 'exploding' headache. She and her husband report that yesterday she was in the kitchen and stood up and hit her head on the corner of a cabinet. The next morning she developed a sudden 'exploding' headache. She came to the hospital where head CT showed a significant amount of blood in her right ventricle. NSGY evaluated her for spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage with a concern for an underlying vascular malformation. Cerebral angiogram was done which showed abnormal vasculature with a draining vein from L temporal lobe penetrating deep white matter consistent with AVM. The patient did continue to have a headaches but they were improving with pain medication. The patient refused PT evaluation but was ambulating independently without difficulty. She was discharged to home with her husband on [**2155-12-6**].

This is a 44 year old female with PMH of PCOS, Obesity, HTN who presented with symptoms of cholecystitis and was found incidentally to have a large pericardial effusion. A pericardiocentesis was performed and the fluid analysis was consistent with Burkitt's lymphoma. Pericardial fluid was kappa light chain restricted CD10 positive monotypic B cells expressing FMC-7, CD19, CD20, and myc rearrangement consistent with Burkitt's Lymphoma. A subsequent lumbar puncture and bone marrow biopsy were negative for any involvement which made this a primary cardiac lymphoma. A cardiac MRI showed a mass that was 3cm x 1cm on the lateral wall of the right atrium adjacent to the AV junction.

Upon further review of symptoms the pt reports + Occasional dizziness, no prior syncope occasional HA, Denies CP/SOB. No sensory or motor defects. He recalls that he might have had a stroke 10-15 years ago without any residual deficit. Prior to CABG he only had diaphoresis.
Further review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. He underwent Carotid U/S that showed significant bilateral carotid stenosis, L>R. Angiography revealed an 80% stenosis of the R ICA and a 90% L ICA stenosis.

60 yo M with Hep C cirrhosis, grade II esophageal varices, recent admission for UGIB [**2-9**] NSAID gastritis, referred for admission throught the ED by hepatology clinic for new slurred speech and tangential thought process. Patient also describes new imbalance leading to a fall during which he may have hit his head on. Per last liver clinic note has been off ETOH for a year (corroborated with pt), utox was negative for alocohol. CT was within normal limits, and neuro evaluation determined this was not ischemic infart. Patient was given a presumptive diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy and started on lactulose. Liver function tests showed a striking increase in his total and direct bilirubin since last visit. Another worrisome feature was the increase in the patient's AFP. This could be progression of cirrhosis as he failed interferon twice. He is to follow-up as an outpatient to work this up.

This is a 57-year-old gentleman with CLL and large cell transformation. He presented with his disease back in [**10/2119**] with an elevated white count and LDH. He was without any splenomegaly or any cytopenias at that time. He did have some bulky lymphadenopathy. He then completed four cycles of FCR therapy, which he completed back in 09/[**2119**]. He had an excellent response to therapy and was monitored off treatment for approximately two years. He then presented in [**7-/2122**] with a rising white count, approximately 50% lymphocytes, and a mildly elevated LDH. He also had some mild worsening palpable lymphadenopathy. He then received four cycles of PCR, but did not have much in the way of response and his treatment regimen was switched to R-CVP of which he received two cycles. He did again not have a significant response, though continued to have an excellent performance status, and he was ultimately switched to Campath therapy. He did have resolution of his lymphocytosis, and his white count has come down nicely, but did not have much in the way of response in terms of reducing his bulky lymphadenopathy. He then eventually had developed an enlarging left cervical node which was biopsied and was found to have Richter's transformation.

41 year old man with history of severe intellectual disability, CHF, epilepsy presenting with facial twitching on the right and generalized shaking in at his NH which required 20 mg valium to cease seizure activity. Per outside medical patient was felt to have focal epilepsy with secondary generalization, likely due to anoxic brain injury at birth, and probably related to the atrophic changes seen on MRI, particularly in the left temporal lobe.
The patient first developed seizures at age 13 found by family to have a generalized convulsion. He had a second seizure two years after his first episode. He was maintained on Dilantin and phenobarbital. The patient went 20 years without another seizure. He was recently tapered off Dilantin, and it was felt that perhaps this medication was necessary to maintain him seizure free. The patient had no further events during the hospital course and was back at his baseline at the time of discharge. Full EEG reports are pending at the time of dictation.
Past Medical History:
Epilepsy as above, CHF, depression

She responded well to 125 mg IV steroids q 8 hrs and IV diphenydramine in addition to her continuing home regimen. CBC was at her baseline, w/normal differential. Serum tryptase revealed a high value at 84. The patient failed aspirin challenge due to adverse reaction. She was stabilized on IV steroids and IV benadryl and transferred back to the medical floor. She continued on her home histamine receptor blockers and was transitioned from IV to PO steroids and benadryl and observed overnight and was discharged on her home meds, prednisone taper, GI prophylaxis with PPI, Calcium and vitamin D, and SS bactrim for PCP.

It was impossible for staff to pass a foley. Urology was consulted, performed a flexible cystoscopy in the ICU and found severe 2cm bulbar urethral stricture. They were able to pass small catheter through and left in place. The patient leaked around the catheter, the catheter eventually came out but he continued to have good urine output and post-void bladder scans were performed q4h to ensure he did not have high residual volume.
