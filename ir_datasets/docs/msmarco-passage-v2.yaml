On July 21, 2021, the task organizers <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/msmarco/commit/41b3a684ed8ebd4e753250c3687547a77c62e7dd">
updated the train, dev1, and dev2 qrels</a> to remove duplicate entries from the files. This should not have change results from
evaluation tools, but may result in non-repeatable results if these files were used in another process (e.g., model training). The
original qrels file for <a class="ds-ref">msmarco-passage-v2/train</a> can be found
<a href="https://mirror.ir-datasets.com/abf1fd024b6aca203364d2138c241a6d">here</a> to aid in result repeatability.

are mapped to documents via URL, these documents are re-passaged, and then the best approximate match is identified.
