"Based the questions in the [MS-MARCO] Question Answering Dataset and the documents which answered
the questions a document ranking task was formulated. There are 3.2 million documents and the goal
is to rank based on their relevance. Relevance labels are derived from what passages was marked as
having the answer in the QnA dataset."
