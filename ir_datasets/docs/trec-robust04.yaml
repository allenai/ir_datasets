The TREC Robust retrieval task focuses on "improving the consistency of retrieval technology by
focusing on poorly performing topics."
</p>
<p>
The TREC Robust document collection is from TREC disks 4 and 5. Due to the
copyrighted nature of the  documents, this collection is for research use only, which requires
agreements to be filed with NIST. See details <a href="https://trec.nist.gov/data/cd45/index.html">here</a>.
</p>

<li>Documents: News articles</li>

<p>
To use this dataset, you need a copy of <a href="https://trec.nist.gov/data/cd45/index.html">TREC
disks 4 and 5</a>, provided by NIST.
</p>
<p>
Your organization may already have a copy. If this is the case, you may only need to complete a new
"Individual Argeement". Otherwise, your organization will need to file the "Organizational agreement"
with NIST. It can take some time to process, but you will end up with a password-protected download link.
</p>
<p>
ir_datasets needs the following directories from the source:
</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>FBIS</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>FR94</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>FT</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>LATIMES</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>
ir_datasets expects the above directories to be copied/linked under <kbd>~/.ir_datasets/trec-robust04/trec45</kbd>.
The source document files themselves can either be compressed or uncompressed (it seems they have been distributed
both ways in the past.) If ir_datasets does not find the files it is expecting, it will raise an error.
