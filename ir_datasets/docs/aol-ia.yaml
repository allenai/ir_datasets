This is a version of the AOL Query Log. Documents use versions that appeared around the time
of the query log (early 2006) via the Internet Archive.
</p>
<p>
The query log does not include document or query IDs. These are instead created by ir_datasets.
Document IDs are assigned using a hash of the URL that appears in the query log. Query IDs are
assigned using the a hash of the noramlised query. All unique normalized queries are available
from <kbd>queries</kbd>, and all clicked documents are available from <kbd>qrels</kbd> (iteration
value set to the user ID). Full information (including original query) are available from
<kbd>qlogs</kbd>.
