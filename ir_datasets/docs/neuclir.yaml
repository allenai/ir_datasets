<p>
This is the dataset created for <a href="https://neuclir.github.io/">TREC 2022 NeuCLIR Track</a>. 
Topics will be developed and released by June 2022 by NIST. 
Relevance judgements will be available after the evaluation (around November). 
</p>
<p>
The collection designed to be similar to [HC4] and a large portion of documents from HC4 are ported to this collection.
Users can conduct experiemnts on this collection with queries and qrels in HC4 for development. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Documents: Web pages from Common Crawl in Chinese, Persian, and Russian.</li>
  <li>
  Queries: (To be released) English TREC-style title/description queries. Narrative field contains an example passage for each relevance level.
  Human and machine translation of the titles and descriptions in the target language (i.e., document language) are provided in the query object. 
  </li>
  <li>Qrels: (To be released)  Documents are judged in three levels of relevance. Please refer to the dataset paper for the full definition of the levels. </li>

Please use the following command to download the documents:
</p>
<code>
git clone https://github.com/NeuCLIR/download-collection<br/>
cd download-collection<br/>
pip install -r requirements.txt<br/>
python download_documents.py --storage ~/.ir_datasets/neuclir/1 \ <br/>
                             --zho ./resource/zho/ids.jsonl.gz \ <br/>
                             --fas ./resource/fas/ids.jsonl.gz \ <br/>
                             --rus ./resource/rus/ids.*.jsonl.gz \ <br/>
                             --jobs {number of process}<br/>
</code>
<p>
After download, please also post-process the downloaded file to verify all and only specified documents are downloaded, and 
modify the ordering of the collection to match the original specified ordering in the id files. 
</p>
<code>
for lang in zho fas rus; do <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;python fix_document_order.py --raw_download_file ~/.ir_datasets/neuclir/1/$lang/docs.jsonl \ <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;                             --id_file ./resource/$lang/ids*.jsonl.gz \ <br/>
