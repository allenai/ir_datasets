  desc: '
<p>
HC4 is a new suite of test collections for ad hoc Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR), 
with Common Crawl News documents in Chinese, Persian, and Russian, topics in English and in 
the document languages, and graded relevance judgments.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Documents: Web pages from Common Crawl in Chinese, Persian, and Russian.</li>
  <li>
  Queries: English TREC-style title/description queries. Narrative field contains an example passage for each relevance level.
  Human and machine translation of the titles and descriptions in the target language (i.e., document language) are provided in the query object. 
  (Titles and descriptions are machine-translated into all three target languages even in the laguages that they are not assessed to facillate CLIR 
  other than English-to-X pairs, e.g., Persian-to-Chinese. Please refer to the original dataset repository for these additional resources.)
  </li>
  <li>Report: Each query comes with an English report that is designed to be written by professional searchers prior to the search.</li>
  <li>Qrels: Documents are judged in three levels of relevance. Please refer to the dataset paper for the full definition of the levels. </li>

<p>
To access the docuemnts of this dataset, you will need to download the documents from Common Crawl. 
The script for downloading and validating the documents are in <a href="https://github.com/hltcoe/HC4">HLTCOE/HC4</a>. 
Please use the following command to download the documents:
<code>
git clone https://github.com/hltcoe/HC4<br/>
cd HC4<br/>
pip install -r requirements.txt<br/>
python download_documents.py --storage ~/.ir_datasets/hc4/ \ <br/>
                             --zho ./resources/hc4/zho/ids.jsonl.gz \ <br/>
                             --fas ./resources/hc4/fas/ids.jsonl.gz \ <br/>
                             --rus ./resources/hc4/rus/ids.*.jsonl.gz \ <br/>
                             --jobs {number of process} \ <br/>
                             --check_hash <br/>
</code>
After download, please also post-process the downloaded file to verify all and only specified documents are downloaded, and 
modify the ordering of the collection to match the original specified ordering in the id files. 
<code>
python fix_document_order.py --hc4_file ./data/{lang}/hc4_docs.jsonl \
                             --id_file ./resources/hc4/{lang}/ids*.jsonl.gz \
                             --check_hash
</code>
You can also store the documents in other directory and create a soft link for <kbd>~/.ir_datasets/hc4/</kbd>.
