  data_access: |
    <p>
    To use this dataset, you need a copy of <a href="https://lemurproject.org/clueweb22/">ClueWeb22</a>,
    provided by the Carnegie Mellon University.
    </p>
    <p>
    Your organization may already have a copy. If this is the case, you may only need to complete a new
    "Individual Argeement". Otherwise, your organization will need to file the "Organizational agreement"
    and pay a fee to the Carnegie Mellon University to get a copy. The data are provided as hard drives that are 
    shipped to you.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once you have the data, ir_datasets will need the directories that look like the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><kbd>ClueWeb22_00</kbd></li>
    <li><kbd>ClueWeb22_01</kbd></li>
    <li><kbd>...</kbd></li>
    <li><kbd>ClueWeb22_XX</kbd></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    ir_datasets expects the above directories to be copied/linked under <kbd>~/.ir_datasets/clueweb22/corpus</kbd>.
