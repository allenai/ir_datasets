    The ClueWeb22 dataset contains 10&nbsp;billion web pages.
    It was developed by the Lemur Project and the Microsoft Corporation.
    </p>
    <p>
    Novel characteristics compared with earlier ClueWeb datasets 
    (<a class="ds-ref">clueweb09</a> and <a class="ds-ref">clueweb12</a>):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is much larger.</li>
      <li>Documents are of higher quality.</li>
      <li>Documents are provided in several formats (HTML, clean text, screen shots).</li>
      <li>Document outlink and inlink data is provided in a convenient format.</li>
      <li>Document page analyses are provided that reveal where on a page text was displayed, 
        and what was near it.</li>
      <li>The dataset includes a large set of crowdsourced queries and shallow relevance assessments 
        (a pseudo search log).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    The dataset is obtained for a fee from the Carnegie Mellon University, and is shipped as hard drives. 
    More information is provided <a href="https://lemurproject.org/clueweb22/obtain.php">here</a>.

  data_access: |
    <p>
    To use this dataset, you need a copy of <a href="https://lemurproject.org/clueweb22/">ClueWeb22</a>,
    provided by the Carnegie Mellon University.
    </p>
    <p>
    Your organization may already have a copy. If this is the case, you may only need to complete a new
    "Individual Argeement". Otherwise, your organization will need to file the "Organizational agreement"
    and pay a fee to the Carnegie Mellon University to get a copy. The data are provided as hard drives that are 
    shipped to you.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once you have the data, ir_datasets will need the directories that look like the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><kbd>ClueWeb22_00</kbd></li>
    <li><kbd>ClueWeb22_01</kbd></li>
    <li><kbd>...</kbd></li>
    <li><kbd>ClueWeb22_XX</kbd></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    ir_datasets expects the above directories to be copied/linked under <kbd>~/.ir_datasets/clueweb22/corpus</kbd>.
