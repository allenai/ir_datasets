The New York Times Annotated Corpus. Consists of articles published between 1987 and 2007. It is
used in TREC Core 2017 and it is also useful for transferring relevance signals in cases where
training data is in short supply.

Uses data from <a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19">LDC2008T19</a>. The source
collection can be downloaded from the LDC.

<p>
To use this dataset, you need a copy of the source corpus, provided by the the
Linguistic Data Consortium. The specific resource needed
is <a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19">LDC2008T19</a>.
</p>
<p>
Many organizations already have a subscription to the LDC, so access to the collection
can be as easy as confirming the data usage agreement and downloading the corpus. Check
with your library for access details.
