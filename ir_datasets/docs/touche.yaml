    Decision making processes, be it at the societal or at the personal level,
    eventually come to a point where one side will challenge the other with a why-question,
    which is a prompt to justify one's stance.
    Thus, technologies for argument mining and argumentation processing are maturing at a rapid pace,
    giving rise for the first time to argument retrieval.
    Touché 2020 is the first lab on Argument Retrieval at CLEF 2020 featuring two tasks.

    Touché 2022 is the third lab on argument retrieval at CLEF 2022 featuring three tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
    Given a comparative topic and a collection of documents, the task is to retrieve relevant argumentative passages for either compared object or for both and to detect their respective stances with respect to the object they talk about.
    </p>
    <p>
    Documents are judged based on their general topical relevance and for rhetorical quality,
    i.e., "well-writtenness" of the document:
    (1) whether the text has a good style of speech (formal language is preferred over informal),
    (2) whether the text has a proper sentence structure and is easy to read,
    (3) whether it includes profanity, has typos, and makes use of other detrimental style choices.
    </p>
    <p>
    Additionally, classify the stance of the retrieved text passages towards the compared objects in questions. For instance, in the question <i>Who is a better friend, a cat or a dog?</i> the terms <i>cat</i> and <i>dog</i> are the comparison objects. An answer candidate like <i>Cats can be quite affectionate and attentive, and thus are good friends</i> should be classified as pro the <i>cat</i> object, while <i>Cats are less faithful than dogs</i> as supporting the <i>dog</i> object.

    Systems are evaluated on Touché topics 1-50 by the ratio of images among the 20 retrieved images for each topic (10 images for each stance) that are all three: relevant to the topic, argumentative, and have the associated stance.
