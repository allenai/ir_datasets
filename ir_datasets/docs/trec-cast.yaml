<p>
To use version 0 of the corpus, you need a copy of the <a href="https://trec.nist.gov/data/wapost/">Washington Post Collection</a>,
provided by NIST.
</p>
<p>
Your organization may already have a copy. If this is the case, you may only need to complete a new
"Individual Argeement". Otherwise, your organization will need to file the "Organizational agreement"
with NIST. It can take some time to process, but you will end up with a password-protected download link.

<p>
For the v0 corpus, the source file required is <kbd>WashingtonPost.v2.tar.gz</kbd>.
ir_datasets expects the above file to be copied/linked under <kbd>~/.ir_datasets/wapo/WashingtonPost.v2.tar.gz</kbd>.

<p>
Version 0 of the TREC CAsT corpus. This version uses documents from the Washington Post (version 2), TREC CAR (version 2),
and MS MARCO passage (version 1).
</p>
<p>
This corpus was originally meant to be used for evaluation of the 2019 task, but the Washington Post
corpus was not included for scoring in the final version due to "an error in the process led to ambiguous
document ids," and Washington Post documents were removed from participating systems. As such,
<a class="ds-ref">trec-cast/v1</a> (which doesn''t include the Washington Post) should be used for
the 2019 version of the task. However, this version still can be used for the training set
(<a class="ds-ref">trec-cast/v0/train</a>) or for replicating the original submissions
to the track (prior to the removal of Washingotn Post documents).
